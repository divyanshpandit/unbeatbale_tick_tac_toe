# Tic Tac Toe - AI vs Human 

This is a simple yet **unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game** that you can play directly in your web browser. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**, making it impossible to defeat. You may win only if the AI allows a draw.

## Features

* **Unbeatable AI** powered by the Minimax algorithm.
* Play as **X**, while the AI plays as **O**.
* Fully interactive and playable in any modern browser.
* Displays game result: "You win!", "AI wins!" or "It's a draw!".

## Why is this AI Unbeatable?

* The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, which simulates all possible future moves to choose the optimal one.
* This ensures the AI will never lose; it can force either a win or a draw.
* **Alpha-Beta Pruning** optimizes the AI decision-making process to improve efficiency.
